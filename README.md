## Make root filesystem read-only!

### About
EasyRO is a script providing read-only mode and read-write mode. It's designed with the goal of 'trying to make it simpler for everyone to make a read-only system'. This can be for many different purposes. such as: self-build router, vpn server etc.

### Instructions
If you don't want to read instructions about how it works, then only run the following command:

  curl https://tomaaien.nl/easyro/install | bash
  

#### Prerequisite
You need: curl, wget, root access and bash.

#### Testing and stable
I've made two version: the testing branch and stable branch. The testing branch is heavily tested when new updates are implemented. At the moment those two are the same.

If you want to install the *stable*  branch:

  curl https://tomaaien.nl/easyro/install | bash
